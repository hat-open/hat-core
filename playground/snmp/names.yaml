    syntax: OCTET STRING
    definition: |
        A textual description of the entity.  This value should
        include the full name and version identification of the
        system's hardware type, software operating-system, and

    syntax: OBJECT IDENTIFIER
    definition: |
        The vendor's authoritative identification of the network
        management subsystem contained in the entity.  This value
        is allocated within the SMI enterprises subtree
        (1.3.6.1.4.1) and provides an easy and unambiguous means
        for determining "what kind of box" is being managed.  For
        example, if vendor "Flintstones, Inc." was assigned the
        subtree 1.3.6.1.4.1.42, it could assign the identifier
        1.3.6.1.4.1.42.1.1 to its "Fred Router".
